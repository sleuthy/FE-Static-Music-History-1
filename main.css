Create five options for the artist select element of any artist that you enjoy.
Create at least five options for the album select element. One, or more, album for each artist.
The links in the navigation bar don't need to link to anything just yet, you can use <a href="#">View music</a> for now
Pick your four favorite songs from the artists you have chosen and use the information for each in the list that's on the right-hand side. You can use h1 tags, div tags, section tags... whatever you like.
